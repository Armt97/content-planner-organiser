# Project Progress Report — Content Planner and Organiser for Social Media Creators

## Completed Tasks (Update)
- Set up a Python virtual environment inside `backend/venv`.
- Installed Flask and created a minimal backend application.
- Implemented two working routes:
  - `/` → returns "Hello, Content Planner!"
  - `/health` → returns a JSON status response.
- Configured the backend to run successfully on port 5001 (due to port 5000 being in use).
- Added `requirements.txt` to track project dependencies.
- Updated GitHub repository with working backend code and dependencies.

## Remaining Tasks
- Connect the backend to serve the frontend `index.html` page.
- Set up Bootstrap for styling and create a simple homepage layout.
- Expand backend endpoints to support core features (Kanban, calendar, hashtag library).
- Prepare deployment environment (AWS EC2/S3).

## Changes in Scope
- No major changes in scope so far. Only technical adjustment: Flask is currently running on port 5001 instead of 5000 due to a port conflict on macOS.
