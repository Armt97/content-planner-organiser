## Project Overview
This project is a web-based content planning and organisation tool designed for social media creators. It aims to provide a simple yet powerful platform for managing content ideas, scheduling posts, and storing reusable hashtags and captions. To further support creators in maintaining a consistent and efficient posting routine, the system will include insightful data visualisations and an interactive grid preview, helping users spot trends, plan aesthetically pleasing layouts, and improve their workflow over time.

## Target Users
Individual content creators, students, freelancers, or small business owners who publish on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. They typically manage content alone and need a centralised, user-friendly system to stay organised, keep consistent, and visually preview their feed layout.

- **Media Preview:** Upload/attach image previews to content cards  
- **Grid Preview (Aesthetic Feed Planner):** Visual feed layout planning

## Tech Stack
